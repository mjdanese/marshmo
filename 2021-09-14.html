        <h4>2021-09-14 / Cat</h4>
        <hr>
        <div class="post">
          
          <p>I adopted a cat with my boyfriend of six months, Wade. We met her at Cat Therapy SB around the time we started dating, and after a few visits Wade made a special connection with her. As someone who wasn't as familiar with cats, I wasn't sure about her persnickety personality - she seemed too cold and independent and I gravitated toward the cuddly kittens who melted at my touch.</p>

          <h6>Vicious furball of death, release to me your sparkly wand</h6>
          
          <p>Despite these attributes, I grew to love her too. It took two tries to adopt her. The first time was a month ago when were told she would need to be adopted with her ill-tempered brother, Plucky. The second time was after Plucky was sent away - she was on her own anyway and the organization agreed she seemed to be doing fine. So now she's ours and we're her's, and it turns out she's cuddly and melts at my touch (Just not all the time).</p>
          <p>Despite not currently living with Wade I am quite at peace with the decision to adopt. I have little doubt we will make a great life for her and I am in awe at the depth of emotion she stirs in me.</p>
          <p>Maybe someday she'll let me wipe the boogers out of her eyes.</p>
